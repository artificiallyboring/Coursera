This module's primary focus was to introduce the world of SQL to you and to get you started with a few simple querying techniques. 
Attached to this posting, are a few good, quality overviews of SQL that go into a little bit more depth than what we can cover in our lecture videos.
I encourage you to check out and review one or more of these resources.
